# General Guidelines for working with Nx

- For navigating/exploring the workspace, invoke the `nx-workspace` skill first - it has patterns for querying projects, targets, and dependencies
- When running tasks (for example build, lint, test, e2e, etc.), always prefer running the task through `nx` (i.e. `nx run`, `nx run-many`, `nx affected`) instead of using the underlying tooling directly
- Prefix nx commands with the workspace's package manager (e.g., `pnpm nx build`, `npm exec nx test`) - avoids using globally installed CLI
- You have access to the Nx MCP server and its tools, use them to help the user
- For Nx plugin best practices, check `node_modules/@nx/<plugin>/PLUGIN.md`. Not all plugins have this file - proceed without it if unavailable.
- NEVER guess CLI flags - always check nx_docs or `--help` first when unsure

## Scaffolding & Generators

- For scaffolding tasks (creating apps, libs, project structure, setup), ALWAYS invoke the `nx-generate` skill FIRST before exploring or calling MCP tools

## When to use nx_docs

- USE for: advanced config options, unfamiliar flags, migration guides, plugin configuration, edge cases
- DON'T USE for: basic generator syntax (`nx g @nx/react:app`), standard commands, things you already know
- The `nx-generate` skill handles generator discovery internally - don't call nx_docs just to look up generator syntax

# Workflow Manager Development Guide

## Core Process

1. **One feature at a time.** Implement the smallest possible increment that can be visually verified or tested. Never batch multiple features into a single pass.
2. **Visual first for TUI work.** Get something on screen before building supporting infrastructure. Mock data is fine — proving the rendering/interaction works is the priority.
3. **Check in at every milestone.** After each feature, stop and tell the user:
   - What was implemented
   - How to test it manually (exact commands)
   - Wait for their feedback before continuing
4. **Don't build what you can't verify.** If behavior depends on real-world interaction (e.g. Claude session status patterns), don't guess — build a testable mock first, observe the real thing, then implement.
5. **Commit after every code-generating or install command.** NX generators, `npm install`, `npm uninstall` — commit immediately before making manual changes.
6. **Iterate with the user, not ahead of the user.** The user is part of the development loop. Their manual QA testing is essential. Don't race ahead building layers of code they haven't seen yet.

## Ink.js / TUI Patterns

- **Use the `cli-design:inkjs-design` skill** for component patterns, layout, input handling, testing, and gotchas. Check it before guessing at Ink APIs.
  - `cli-design:inkjs-cli layout` — responsive layout, `useStdout` for terminal dimensions
  - `cli-design:inkjs-cli testing` — `ink-testing-library` patterns
  - `cli-design:inkjs-cli input` — keyboard input, `useInput` patterns
  - `cli-design:inkjs-cli gotchas` — emoji width, Ctrl+C, useInput conflicts
- **Full-screen layout:** Use `useStdout()` to get `rows`/`columns`, set `height={rows}` on root `<Box>`.
- **PTY sizing:** The PTY session is sized to match the terminal dimensions minus UI chrome (sidebar width, borders, status bar).
- **ESM required:** Ink v6 + yoga-layout use top-level await. All packages must have `"type": "module"` in package.json.

## Testing Strategy

- **TDD for libraries:** `worktree-manager` (worktree.ts) — mock `exec`, test parsing and CRUD logic.
- **Ink components:** Use `ink-testing-library` to verify text content + keyboard navigation. No real TTY needed.
- **Manual testing for:** ANSI/visual rendering, PTY input forwarding, anything involving real terminal interaction.
- **Run tests via NX:** `npx nx test worktree-manager`
- **Dev run:** `npx nx serve cli` (rebuilds stale lib deps, then runs via tsx)

### E2E Tests (tui-test)

E2E tests live in `apps/cli-e2e/` and use `@microsoft/tui-test` (Playwright-style PTY testing). They run against the built CLI binary.

```sh
# Run all e2e tests (fast tests only, integration tests are skipped without GH_TOKEN)
npx nx e2e cli-e2e
```

**tui-test gotcha:** `test.use()` only accepts `TestOptions` (rows, columns, shell, env, program). `timeout` is a `defineConfig`-only property — do not put it in `test.use()`. SWC won't catch the type error locally, but CI `typecheck` will fail.

### Integration Tests

Integration tests exercise real GitHub operations and are **skipped** when `GH_TOKEN` is not set.

- `merge-auto-delete.test.ts` — creates branches, PRs, merges, verifies Kirby auto-deletes the session
- `reviews-fixture.test.ts` — reads 3 permanent fixture PRs in the test repo, verifies the Reviews tab categorizes them correctly

**Running locally:**

```sh
GH_TOKEN=<fine-grained-PAT> npx nx e2e cli-e2e
```

**Required PAT permissions** (scoped to the test repo only):

- Contents: Read & Write (clone, push branches, delete branches)
- Pull requests: Read & Write (create, merge, close PRs)
- The PAT owner must have admin access on the test repo (for `--admin` merge)

**Environment variables:**

- `GH_TOKEN` — fine-grained PAT for the test repo (required to run integration tests)
- `TEST_REPO` — override the test repo (default: `kirby-test-runner/kirby-integration-test-repository`)
- `KIRBY_LOG` — set automatically by the test to capture debug logs from the Kirby process

**Fixture PRs in the test repo** (used by `reviews-fixture.test.ts`):

| PR  | Branch                      | Title                               | CI     | Review (by kirby-test-runner)         |
| --- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------- |
| #37 | `fixture/add-color-support` | Add color support for tile values   | passes | Approved                              |
| #38 | `fixture/add-undo-feature`  | Add undo feature with history stack | passes | Changes requested (3 inline comments) |
| #39 | `fixture/add-ai-solver`     | Add AI solver for auto-play mode    | fails  | Approved (1 suggestion comment)       |

These PRs are permanent fixtures — tests only read them, never modify. The test repo contains a C 2048 game project.

**CI pipelines:**

- **CI** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) — runs `nx affected -t lint test build typecheck e2e`. Integration tests are skipped (no `GH_TOKEN`).
- **Integration Tests** (`.github/workflows/integration.yml`) — runs `npx nx e2e cli-e2e` with `GH_TOKEN` from the `INTEGRATION_TEST_PAT` secret. Triggers on PRs, pushes to master, and manual dispatch. Uses `concurrency` with `cancel-in-progress: false` because the test repo is shared state.

## Project Structure

```
apps/cli/                        — Ink TUI application (ESM, React 19)
  src/main.tsx                   — Entry point, root component
  src/pty-registry.ts            — PTY session lifecycle (spawn, get, kill)
  src/input-handlers.ts          — Shared input types (NavValue, etc.) + settings/controls handlers
  src/keybindings/               — Customizable keybinding system
    registry.ts                  — Action catalog, presets (Normie/Vim), ActionId type
    resolver.ts                  — matchesKey, resolveAction, findConflict, descriptorFromKeypress
    hints.ts                     — Human-readable key display strings
    controls-data.ts             — Controls panel data logic (buildControlsRows, getBindingRows)
  src/components/                — Shared components (SidebarLayout, TerminalView, TabBar, StatusBar, etc.)
  src/screens/main/              — Main tab (sidebar, diff, branch picker, confirm dialogs)
  src/screens/reviews/           — Reviews tab (DiffFileList, DiffViewer, ReviewDetailPane)
  src/context/                   — React contexts (AppState, Session, Config, Keybind, Layout, Sidebar)
  src/hooks/                     — Custom hooks (useTerminal, useDiffData, useSettings)
libs/worktree-manager/           — Git worktree and branch operations
  src/lib/worktree.ts            — Worktree CRUD, branch utils, conflict checks
libs/terminal/                   — PTY session + terminal emulation (node-pty + @xterm/headless)
  src/lib/pty-session.ts         — node-pty wrapper
  src/lib/terminal-emulator.ts   — @xterm/headless wrapper with ANSI rendering
```

## Known Decisions & Learnings

- **ANSI passthrough works:** TerminalEmulator (@xterm/headless) renders ANSI output which Ink `<Text>` passes directly to the terminal. Colors, bold, underline all render correctly.
- **Input forwarding works:** Raw stdin → PTY write round-trip is responsive enough for interactive use. Mouse tracking and scrollback navigation are supported.
- **NX workspace uses `apps/*` + `libs/*`** (not default `packages/*`). Workspaces configured in root package.json.
- **`npx nx sync`** may be needed when adding cross-library dependencies (e.g. worktree-manager importing terminal).
- **`TSX_TSCONFIG_PATH`:** The serve target sets this env var so tsx picks up `jsx: "react-jsx"` from `tsconfig.app.json`. Without it, tsx defaults to classic JSX transform and requires `import React`.

## PR Reviews via CLI

When reviewing a pull request, use `gh` CLI — not the workflow-manager agent.

### Gathering info

- `gh pr view <number> --json title,body,files,headRefOid,headRepositoryOwner,headRepository` — get metadata and the commit SHA needed for the review API
- `gh pr diff <number>` — get the full diff (pipe to a file or read tool if large)
- `gh repo view --json nameWithOwner` — get the `owner/repo` for API calls

### Posting inline review comments

Use the GitHub API directly to post a review with inline comments:

```bash
cat <<'EOF' | gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/NUMBER/reviews --input -
{
  "commit_id": "<head SHA from gh pr view>",
  "body": "Overall review summary here.",
  "event": "COMMENT",
  "comments": [
    {
      "path": "relative/file/path.ts",
      "line": 42,
      "side": "RIGHT",
      "body": "Comment on the new code at this line."
    }
  ]
}
EOF
```

- `line` is the line number in the **new version** of the file (right side of the diff)
- `side: "RIGHT"` targets the new code; use `"LEFT"` to comment on removed lines
- `event` can be `"COMMENT"`, `"APPROVE"`, or `"REQUEST_CHANGES"`

### Changing review status without duplicating comments

To set "Changes requested" after already posting inline comments, submit a **separate review with no `comments` array** — just `body` and `event`:

```bash
cat <<'EOF' | gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/NUMBER/reviews --input -
{
  "commit_id": "<head SHA>",
  "body": "Requesting changes — see inline comments.",
  "event": "REQUEST_CHANGES"
}
EOF
```

This adds the blocking status without duplicating any inline comments.

### Things to watch out for

- **Always prefix AI-generated comments** with "AI generated:" so it's clear they don't come directly from the repo owner
- **Don't use `gh pr review`** for inline comments — it only supports a single body comment, not per-line annotations
- **Line numbers come from the new file**, not diff positions — count from the `@@` hunk headers to get them right
- **Heredoc quoting matters** — use `<<'EOF'` (quoted) to prevent shell expansion inside the JSON body
